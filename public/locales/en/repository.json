  "From myself": "I was finishing it up quickly, so I didn’t fully think through the design for such a small amount of content. I didn’t want to leave the space empty :) I tried to replicate GitHub’s design as much as possible, and I hope you noticed that. Many components could have been better implemented in terms of modularity. For example, in the \"Langswitcher,\" it would have been better to extract the dropdown into a \"widgets\" folder to make it reusable. In \"searchrepos,\" a lot could have been moved to shared or widgets, and I ended up writing the styles very quickly towards the end... I also used webpack instead of Vite and realized it a bit late. I didn’t have time to work on performance at all..., though I did set up suspense and asynchronous loading of languages. The design, by the way, is adapted for all devices! Writing a bit incoherently — just really sleepy :) I only wrote tests and stories for a couple of components because I was wrapping it up by then :( \n\nAs for successes— all functionality is implemented! Additionally, I had to send the token to the backend to retrieve the user’s token separately. Another detail is that if a very long string is entered in the input field, the site won’t \"break\" :) I also wanted to handle the case where there are too many languages in a repository: starting from a certain number, I planned to add a dropdown with a \"show all\" button but didn’t get to it. Overall, while not everything is perfect, I believe this project is easily extendable and aligns with \"clean code\" standards (of course, there’s always room for improvement)."
